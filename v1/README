The Python main.py is not integrated with the mqtt files yet. Due to the fact you cannot have a constant loop in the paho mqtt
broker, I thought to use the main.py file to call and execute the broker file on mqtt. This is yet to be done, will have it done
tomorrow. Right now you can manually call the publish (only got one sensor in it, will need to create more, thinking of using 
multiple instead of single to publish, cleaner this way).
